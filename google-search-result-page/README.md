This is the final result of my replicating google search result page. From this exercise, I become more familiar with some CSS syntaxes, including `position` and `display:flex`.

Hoowever, there are still something to improve in this exercise. 
  1. The menu buttons under the search bar are not exactly the same as the real google buttons. I cannot find the exact same icons and I think it is out of the scope of this exercise if I create my own icons so I simply leave it that way.
  2. The menu under the search bar I build is not responsive. It will be squeezed and there will be some overlaps among these icons if it is displayed in a small screen. However, other components are fine under samll screens.
